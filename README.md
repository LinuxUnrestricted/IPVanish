# IPVanish
Updated IPVanish.Com Script
Torrent Edition

Updated IPVanish.com script that impliments torrenting VPN automation.

This version will not allow you to STOP the VPN unless all torrenting software is closed.

It also verifies the IP change after START is implimented to verify you are protected and ready to torrent.

Just like in the previous verion STATUS can be implimented at any time to check the current IP.

This software checks for: transmission
                          KTorrent
                          Titati
                          Deluge
                          qBittorrent
                          Vuze
                          Frostwire
                          uTorrent
Before VPN can disconnect.
